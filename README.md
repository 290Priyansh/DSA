# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository documents my **ongoing practice of Data Structures and Algorithms**, with an emphasis on **problem-solving fundamentals, clarity of thought, and consistency**.

I began practicing DSA on LeetCode prior to creating this repository.  
This GitHub repository was started later as a place to **organize and track solutions**, including both **new problems and selected solutions from earlier practice**.

As a result, the order of problems in this repository does **not strictly reflect the chronological order of learning or difficulty**.

---

## 📅 Practice Approach

- Solutions are added incrementally over time
- Includes a mix of newly solved problems and previously solved ones
- Focus is on understanding and correctness rather than upload order
- Code may be revisited and refined as concepts mature

---

## 🧩 Problem Coverage

Problems in this repository span multiple core DSA areas, such as:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Hashing  
- Two Pointers / Sliding Window  
- Stack & Queue  
- Trees (DFS / BFS)  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Binary Search  
- Dynamic Programming  

Problems are **not strictly organized by topic, difficulty, or upload sequence**, as the repository reflects real practice rather than a guided course structure.

## 🧠 Solution Philosophy

Each solution focuses on:
- Correct interpretation of the problem statement
- Identifying the key idea or pattern
- Writing clear and maintainable code
- Explicit handling of edge cases
- Reasonable time and space complexity

## 📌 Note

This repository is maintained primarily for:
- Tracking personal problem-solving work
- Sharing solutions with interviewers
- Reflecting genuine learning progression rather than curated presentation
