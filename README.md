# Data Structures & Algorithms  (Daily Practice)

This repository documents my **daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms**, with a focus on consistency, clarity, and conceptual understanding.

Instead of uploading all solved problems at once, I add **one problem per day**, starting with **Arrays**, and gradually covering other core DSA topics.  
This approach helps reinforce patterns, improve problem-solving depth, and build long-term retention.

## 📅 Learning Strategy

- One problem uploaded per day
- Problems grouped by topic/pattern
- Emphasis on understanding over volume
- Regular refactoring as concepts mature

---

## 🧩 Topics (in progress)

- Arrays 
- Strings
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Hashing
- Stack & Queue
- Trees (DFS / BFS)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming

> Topics will be unlocked progressively as part of structured learning.

## 🧠 Solution Philosophy

Each solution focuses on:
- Identifying the underlying pattern
- Writing clean, readable code
- Handling edge cases explicitly
